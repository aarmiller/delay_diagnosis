Hey Alan,
I hope you had a great honeymoon. I wasn't sure if you were going to be back for the meeting today. Phil and Joe will be on, but I am going to be gone from today through this weekend. So I wanted to give you a heads up on a couple of items Phil would like you to work on, he will describe these in more detail during the meeting.
First, we have preliminary delay reports run for both PE and lung cancer. However, he would also like the risk factor reports run if possible by the end of this week (Roger is giving a talk). I tried to run the preliminary risk factor report last night, but the job was killed for both conditions. I haven't had time to diagnosis the problem, but I think it is due to the large size of the population for PE and lung cancer. If you are able to get a script running to generate these results, that would be great. However, because of the short timeline you might have to fall back on running a single risk-factor model the way we did in the past (i.e., not running a model for each bootstrapped sample, but instead using potential missed opportunities.) BTW, the script for the risk models can be found at delay_diagnosis/build_scripts/R/make_delay_report.R in the delay_diagnosis repo.
Second, if you have time after generating the risk reports for PE and lung cancer, we then need to turn to Sarcoid. I got new SSDs and index criteria from our collaborators in Pulmonary. I have integrated this into the codeBuildr package and regenerated all of the preliminary results on the statepi_diagnosis drive (i.e., change-point report, delay report, risk models, etc.) Now the only thing left to do is to generate a final delay analysis (i.e., the 2-layer bootstrap) and a final set of risk models for the paper. For the paper they would like to add the following factors to the risk model, in addition to the basic stuff we already control for (e.g., age categories, sex, month, year).:
Obesity - consider indicators for both any obesity and/or morbid obesity using the following code sets:
Morbid Obesity (ICD9: 278.01, ICD10: E66.01, E66.2)
Any Obesity (ICD9: 278.0X [278.00, 278.01, 278.02, 278.03] or ICD10: E66.X [E66, E66.0, E66.01, E66.09, E66.1, E66.2, E66.3, E66.8, E66.9])
Medications received during the opportunity window (or at a missed opportunity). There is a dataset saved at /Shared/Statepi_Diagnosis/projects/sarcoid/code_sets/drug_risk_factor_codes.RData that contains the ndc codes for the following conditions
Oral Steroids
Inhalers
Other - the object other_drugs contains NDC codes and categories of drug classes, we essentially want an indicator in the model for each drug class. We may drop some of these if they lack sufficient observations.
Let me know if you have any questions. Phil can give more details during the meeting today (if you are able to attend). I will try to check-in on Slack from time to time. But if I don't get back to you, feel free to pursue whatever options you think are best.
Thanks

Hey Alan, sorry for not getting this to you sooner. Here are some next steps for the antibiotic CDI paper and the sarcoid delay paper:
For the antibiotic CDI paper, could you repeat the analysis but exclude patients under 18. Phil and I were going through the plots and we are still a bit concerned about the lack of monotonicity across antibiotics. This is a situation where we know from the biological mechanisms involved, that longer duration should increase microbiome disruption and thus imply greater CDI risk. Phil thought that some of the conflicting trends could be driven by different pediatric indications versus adult indications (e.g., some antibiotics are used completely differently in kids). So we wanted to check the effect of removing kids, as one final attempt at observing the duration relationship. If this still does not work out, our next strategy will be to turn to specific indications (e.g., UTI, respiratory infections) and focus on the antibiotics used to treat such conditions.
For the sarcoid project we would like to do the following:
Only include treatments during the delay window in the missed patients model and the duration model - these effects should proceed a missed opportunity rather than increase the risk for a missed opportunity (i.e., cough med prescribed for symptoms of sarcoid following a missed opportunity) so they don't make much sense in the missed opportunity model.
For treatments in the risk model, remove antifungals and anti-inflamatory drugs - these were deemed too speculative
Keep antiacids/PPI, antibiotics, antihistamines, cough suppressants, diuretics, inhalers, nasal spray and oral steroids
Combine Antiacids and PPIs into a single indicator - these medications treat the same condition/symptom and from the model appear to exhibit a similar effect
Remove morbid obesity as a separate indicator and just have a single "any obesity indicator" - obesity codes already lack sensitivity and specificity to a degree and we can't really be confident we can distinguish the two, so a single indicator is probably best
For the missed opportunity model, run two models: one with the various setting types broken out like the current model, another where we just have a single indicator for inpatient stay on a given day.
Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

ALAN: so the ssds for sarcoid_lung and sarcoid_skin in codeBuildr are the same. However, they are different than sarcoid. There are 22 additional dx codes in the sarcoid list (see below for more details)
12:55
library(tidyverse)
all.equal(codeBuildr::load_ssd_codes(“sarcoid_lung”), codeBuildr::load_ssd_codes(“sarcoid_skin”))
all.equal(codeBuildr::load_ssd_codes(“sarcoid_lung”), codeBuildr::load_ssd_codes(“sarcoid”))
dplyr::anti_join(codeBuildr::load_ssd_codes(“sarcoid”), codeBuildr::load_ssd_codes(“sarcoid_lung”)) %>%
  dplyr::inner_join(codeBuildr::all_icd_labels %>%
                      mutate(type = paste0(“icd”,dx_ver)) %>%
                      select(code = dx, desc, type))

AARON: I think use the ones in the codeBuildr package. I put the ones in from the last round of review we did with them. I recall asking them if we really should use the same SSDs and they said yes. Doesn't make a lot of sense to me...but they are in charge of this one.

ALAN: Oh ok so I will use the sarcoid ssds for both sarcoid_lung and sarcoid_skin then
