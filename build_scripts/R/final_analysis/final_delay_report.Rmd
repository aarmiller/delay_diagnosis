# Delay Report for `r cond_label`

There were `r total_patients` enrollees diagnosed with `r cond_label`.

The diagnostic opportunity window (i.e., time period before diagnosis where diagnostic opportunities may occur) was set between 1 and `r delay_params$cp` days before diagnosis.

### Visit Trends

In the `r delay_params$upper_bound`-days prior to the index dengue diagnosis, `r percent_patient_any_vis_in_study_period`% (`r total_patient_any_vis_in_study_period`) of patients had at least one healthcare visit for any reason and `r percent_patient_ssd_in_study_period`% (`r total_patient_ssd_in_study_period`) had at least one SSD visit. There was a total of `r total_ssd_visit_days_in_study_period` SSD-visit days in the `r delay_params$upper_bound`-days prior to diagnosis. 

Of the `r total_patients` patients considered, `r total_patient_any_vis_in_window` patients (`r percent_patient_any_vis_in_window`%) had a healthcare visit during diagnostic opportunity window. Additionally, of the `r total_patients` patients considered, `r total_patient_ssd_vis_in_window` patients (`r percent_patient_ssd_vis_in_window`%) had an SSD-related visit during diagnostic opportunity window.

*Potential diagnostic opportunities:* During the diagnostic opportunity window there were `r total_visit_days_in_window` total patient visit days (i.e., days when a patient encountered the healthcare system), and of these visit days `r total_ssd_visit_days_in_window` represented SSD-visit days (i.e., days where a patient presented with signs, symptoms or symptomatically similar diseases to `r cond_label`).

The following is a plot of all patient visits and SSD-related visits that occurred in the `r delay_params$upper_bound` days prior to the index `r cond_label` diagnosis.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bind_rows(all_dx_visits %>% 
            inner_join(ssd_codes) %>%
            distinct(patient_id,days_since_index) %>% 
            count(days_since_index) %>% 
            mutate(group = "SSD Visits"),
          visit_counts %>% 
            filter(days_since_index<0) %>% 
            filter(is.na(dx_ver)) %>% 
            select(days_since_index,n) %>% 
            mutate(group = "All Visits")) %>% 
  filter(days_since_index<0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(-days_since_index,n)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_reverse() +
  ylab("Number of Visits") +
  xlab("Days Before Diagnosis") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = delay_params$cp), linetype = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~group, scales = "free_y")

```

## Final Model Selected

The `r delay_params$final_model` model with periodicity = `r delay_params$periodicity` was selected as the final model for the analysis.

## Expected Visit Trends

The following figure depicts the estimated trends in the number of expected visit counts (red line) for SSD-related visits compared to the observed number (black line). The dashed line represents the start of the diagnostic opportunity window. Plots are presented using a `r delay_params$final_model` model with periodicity = `r delay_params$periodicity` to fit the expected number of visits each day before the diagnostic opportunity window for SSD-related and ALL visits, respectively. 

```{r, echo = FALSE,fig.align="center", out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(sim_in_path, "visit_trends.jpeg"))
```

The following table summarizes the observed and expected number of visits and the estimated number of missed opportunities using the final model plotted above:

The following plot describes the estimated number of missed opportunities each day before the index diagnosis using each of the four models described above:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
comb_counts <- bind_rows(ssd_vis_count %>% mutate(vis = "SSD Visits"),
                         all_vis_count %>% mutate(vis = "ALL Visits"))

comb_counts %>% 
  filter(period<delay_params$cp) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(period,num_miss)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  scale_x_reverse() +
  ylab("Number of Missed Opportunities") +
  xlab("Days Before Index Diagnosis") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~vis) 
```

## SSD Visit Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# load ssd miss results
load(paste0(sim_in_path,"aggregated_sim_results.RData"))
selected_model_missed_opp <- filter(pred_table,vis=="SSD Visits")$`Number Missed (95%CI)`
selected_model_missed_opp <- stringr::str_replace(selected_model_missed_opp, "\\(", "(95%CI: ")
```

The final selected model (based on model fit prior to the diagnostic opportunity window) was the `r delay_params$final_model` model with periodicity = `r delay_params$periodicity`. This model gives an estimated number of missed opportunities of `r selected_model_missed_opp`

### Simulation (Bootstrapping) Results

The following section summarizes results of the bootstrapping/simulation analysis where the individual specific visits representing a diagnostic delay were repeatedly sampled. A total of `r delay_params$boot_trials` bootstrap trials and  `r delay_params$sim_trials` simulation trials were used for this analysis.

The following table is an overall summary of the frequency and duration of missed opportunities:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
agg_stats_ssd$main_stats %>% 
  select(key = measure,out = measure_out) %>% 
  inner_join(tribble(~key,~Measure,
                     "n_pat","Number of Patients Missed",
                     "pct_miss","Percent of Patients Missed",
                     "mean_dur","Mean Duration of Delays (Days)",
                     "median_dur","Median Duration of Delays (Days)",
                     "mean_n_miss","Mean Number of Misses per patient delayed",
                     "median_n_miss","Median Number of Misses per patient delayed"),.) %>% 
  select(Measure,Value = out) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

The following table is a summary of the distribution of delay duration (i.e., number of days between initial symptom presentation and diagnosis):

```{r, echo = FALSE}

         `Percent of All Patients` = pct_all,
         `Percent of Patients with Miss` = pct_miss) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

The following table is a summary of the distribution of the number of missed opportunities (i.e., number of times a patient presented with symptoms but was not diagnosed) that each patient experienced:

  mutate(across(pct_opp_missed_mean:pct_opp_missed_high, ~trimws(format(round(.,2), nsmall = 2)))) %>%

         total_opp = paste0(total_opps_mean," (",total_opps_low,"-",total_opps_high,")"),

### Results by patient location (Rurality)

The following table provides a breakdown of results by patient location, particularly whether the patient was located in a rural versus an urban or non-rural setting.

```{r}
location_counts %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

## Any Visit Results

The following sections provide the same types of results presented above but uses any visit, regardless of whether an SSD was present or not. These results represent a type of "upper bound" on the estimated number of missed opportunities by accounting for cases in which a symptom may not have been recorded during a visit.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# load ssd miss results
selected_model_missed_opp <- filter(pred_table,vis=="ALL Visits")$`Number Missed (95%CI)`
selected_model_missed_opp <- stringr::str_replace(selected_model_missed_opp, "\\(", "(95%CI: ")
```

The final selected model (based on model fit prior to the diagnostic opportunity window) was the `r delay_params$final_model` model with periodicity = `r delay_params$periodicity`. This model gives an estimated number of missed opportunities of `r selected_model_missed_opp`

### Simulation (Bootstrapping) Results

The following section summarizes results of the bootstrapping/simulation analysis where the individual specific visits representing a diagnostic delay were repeatedly sampled. A total of `r delay_params$boot_trials` bootstrap trials and  `r delay_params$sim_trials` simulation trials were used for this analysis.

The following table is an overall summary of the frequency and duration of missed opportunities:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
agg_stats_all$main_stats %>% 
  select(key = measure,out = measure_out) %>% 
  inner_join(tribble(~key,~Measure,
                     "n_pat","Number of Patients Missed",
                     "pct_miss","Percent of Patients Missed",
                     "mean_dur","Mean Duration of Delays (Days)",
                     "median_dur","Median Duration of Delays (Days)",
                     "mean_n_miss","Mean Number of Misses per patient delayed",
                     "median_n_miss","Median Number of Misses per patient delayed"),.) %>% 
  select(Measure,Value = out) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

The following table is a summary of the distribution of delay duration (i.e., number of days between initial symptom presentation and diagnosis):

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dur_bins_all%>% 
  mutate(Duration = ifelse(duration_bin==1,
                           paste0(">= ",duration_bin, " Day"),
                           paste0(">= ",duration_bin, " Days"))) %>% 
  select(Duration,`Number of Patients`=n,
         `Percent of All Patients` = pct_all,
         `Percent of Patients with Miss` = pct_miss) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

The following table is a summary of the distribution of the number of missed opportunities (i.e., number of times a patient presented with symptoms but was not diagnosed) that each patient experienced:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
miss_bins_all %>% 
  mutate(miss_bin = paste0(">=",miss_bin)) %>% 
  rename(`Number of misses` = miss_bin,
         `Number of Patients`=n,
         `Percent of All Patients` = pct_all,
         `Percent of Patients with Miss` = pct_miss) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

The following table summarizes the basic types of settings where missed opportunities occurred:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# setting_counts_all$setting_type_res  %>%
#   mutate(per_mean_by_vis_days = gsub(" ", "", format(round(n_mean/pred_table_all_vis$`Number Missed` *100, 2), nsmall = 2)),
#          per_low_by_vis_days = gsub(" ", "", format(round(n_low/pred_table_all_vis$`Number Missed` *100, 2), nsmall = 2)),
#          per_high_by_vis_days = gsub(" ", "", format(round(n_high/pred_table_all_vis$`Number Missed` *100, 2), nsmall = 2))) %>% 

setting_counts_all$setting_type_res %>% 
  mutate(across(n_mean:n_high, ~ceiling(.))) %>% 
  mutate(across(pct_mean:pct_vis_days_high, ~trimws(format(round(.,2), nsmall = 2)))) %>% 
  mutate(n = paste0(n_mean," (",n_low,"-",n_high,")"),
         pct = paste0(pct_mean," (",pct_low,"-",pct_high,")"),
         pct_vis_days = paste0(pct_mean_vis_days," (",pct_vis_days_low,"-",pct_vis_days_high,")")) %>%
  select(`Setting Type` = setting_type,
         `Number of Missed Opportunities` = n,
         `Percent of Missed opportunities` = pct,
         `Percent of Missed Visit Days` = pct_vis_days) %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

The following table provides a more detailed summary of all the specific types of locations where missed opportunities occurred:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# setting_counts_all$stdplac_res %>%
#   mutate(per_mean_by_vis_days = gsub(" ", "", format(round(n_mean/pred_table_all_vis$`Number Missed` *100, 2), nsmall = 2)),
#          per_low_by_vis_days = gsub(" ", "", format(round(n_low/pred_table_all_vis$`Number Missed` *100, 2), nsmall = 2)),
#          per_high_by_vis_days = gsub(" ", "", format(round(n_high/pred_table_all_vis$`Number Missed` *100, 2), nsmall = 2))) %>% 
#   mutate(pct_vis_days = paste0(per_mean_by_vis_days, " (", per_low_by_vis_days, "-", per_high_by_vis_days, ")" )) %>% 
#   inner_join(smallDB::stdplac_labels, by = "stdplac") %>%

setting_counts_all$stdplac_res %>%
  mutate(across(n_mean:n_high, ~ceiling(.))) %>% 
  mutate(across(pct_mean:pct_vis_days_high, ~trimws(format(round(.,2), nsmall = 2)))) %>% 
  mutate(n = paste0(n_mean," (",n_low,"-",n_high,")"),
         pct = paste0(pct_mean," (",pct_low,"-",pct_high,")"),
         pct_vis_days = paste0(pct_mean_vis_days," (",pct_vis_days_low,"-",pct_vis_days_high,")")) %>%
  select(Setting = label,
         `Number of Misses`=n,
         `Percent of Missed Opportunities` = pct,
         `Percent of Missed Visit Days` = pct_vis_days) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(label)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```
